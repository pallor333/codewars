# The museum of incredibly dull things

The museum of incredibly dull things wants to get rid of some exhibits. Miriam, the interior architect, comes up with a plan to remove the most boring exhibits. She gives them a rating, and then removes the one with the lowest rating.

However, just as she finished rating all exhibits, she's off to an important fair, so she asks you to write a program that tells her the ratings of the exhibits after removing the lowest one. Fair enough.

Given an array of integers, remove the smallest value. **Do not mutate the original array/list.** If there are multiple elements with the same value, remove the one with the lowest index. If you get an empty array/list, return an empty array/list.

Don't change the order of the elements that are left.

### Examples

```
* Input: [1,2,3,4,5], output = [2,3,4,5]
* Input: [5,3,2,1,4], output = [5,3,2,4]
* Input: [2,2,1,2,1], output = [2,2,2,1]
```

Answer:
```
function removeSmallest(numbers) {
  //Empty array end immediately 
  if(numbers.length===0){
    return numbers;
  }
  
  let excitingArr = [];
  let least = numbers[0], idx = 0;
  
  numbers.forEach((num, index) => {
    //Cloning num array
    excitingArr.push(num);
    //Checking for first instance of smallest value
    if(num < least){
      least = num;
      idx = index;
      }
  });
  //Remove smallest value in O(1) time
  excitingArr.splice(idx, 1)
  return excitingArr;
}
```

# Given a string, you have to return a string in which each character (case-sensitive) is repeated once.

### Examples (Input -> Output):

```
* "String"      -> "SSttrriinngg"
* "Hello World" -> "HHeelllloo  WWoorrlldd"
* "1234!_ "     -> "11223344!!__  "
```

My Answer:
```
function doubleChar(str) {
  let dblStr = "";
  for(let i = 0; i<str.length;i++){
    dblStr+=str[i]+str[i];
  }
  return dblStr;
}
```

Answer:
```
const doubleChar = (str) => str.split("").map(c => c + c).join("");
```

# Remove exclamation marks
Write function RemoveExclamationMarks which removes all exclamation marks from a given string.

Answer:
```
function removeExclamationMarks(s) {
  return s.split('!').join('');
}
```
Another solution:
```
function removeExclamationMarks(s) {
  return s.replace(/!/g, '');
}
```

# Reverse String
Complete the function that accepts a string parameter, and reverses each word in the string. All spaces in the string should be retained.

Examples:
"This is an example!" ==> "sihT si na !elpmaxe"
"double spaces" ==> "elbuod secaps"

Answer:

```
function reverseWords(str) {
	return str.split('').map(word) => {
		return word.split('').reverse().join('');
	}.join('')
```
- str.split(' ') creates an array based on splitting based on each space. "The quick brown fox jumped over the moon." turns into ["The", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumped", "over", "the", "moon."]

- Map allows us to call a function on each element of the newly formed array. Then on each word in the array, we split by letter, with split(''), reverse the order in the arrays with reverse() and then join the letters back into words with join(''). Finally we add a .join(' ') method after the map() to combine every word in the array into a string, adding a space after each word.

# Convert String to Array
Write a function to split a string and convert it into an array of words.
### Examples (Input ==> Output):

```
"Robin Singh" ==> ["Robin", "Singh"]

"I love arrays they are my favorite" ==> ["I", "love", "arrays", "they", "are", "my", "favorite"]
```
Answer:
```
const stringToArray = string => string.split(" ");
```
# Find the next integral perfect square
You might know some pretty large perfect squares. But what about the NEXT one?

Complete the findNextSquare method that finds the next integral perfect square after the one passed as a parameter. Recall that an integral perfect square is an integer n such that sqrt(n) is also an integer.

If the argument is itself not a perfect square then return either -1 or an empty value like None or null, depending on your language. You may assume the argument is non-negative.

Examples ( Input --> Output )
121 --> 144
625 --> 676
114 --> -1 # because 114 is not a perfect square

Answer:
```
function findNextSquare(sq){
	return math.sqrt(sq)%1 -1 : Math.pow(Math.sqrt(sq)+1, 2);
}
```
Math(sq)%1 is truthy/falsy. When it's not an integer it equals some number (e.g. 32.4893), which is truthy. When it is an integer the remainder is 0 which is falsy. Overall an elegant way to solve this problem. The only issue is that we're calling math.sqrt() twice. Is it more efficient to declare a variable to use?
# Count the smiley faces!
Given an array (arr) as an argument complete the function countSmileys that should return the total number of smiling faces.

Rules for a smiling face:
- Each smiley face must contain a valid pair of eyes. Eyes can be marked as : or ;
- A smiley face can have a nose but it does not have to. Valid characters for a nose are - or ~
- Every smiling face must have a smiling mouth that should be marked with either ) or D
No additional characters are allowed except for those mentioned.

Valid smiley face examples: :) :D ;-D :~)
Invalid smiley faces: ;( :> :} :]

Example:
countSmileys([':)', ';(', ';}', ':-D']);       // should return 2;
countSmileys([';D', ':-(', ':-)', ';~)']);     // should return 3;
countSmileys([';]', ':[', ';*', ':$', ';-D']); // should return 1;

Note:
In case of an empty array return 0. You will not be tested with invalid input (input will always be an array). Order of the face (eyes, nose, mouth) elements will always be the same.

Answer:
```
function countSmileys(arr) { 
  let countSmiles = 0;
  
  arr.forEach(smile =>{
    if(smile[0]  === ':' || smile[0]  === ';'){ //check eyes
      if(smile.length === 2){ //No nose, check mouth only
        smile[1] === ')' || smile[1] === 'D' ? countSmiles++ : null;
       }else{ //Check nose and mouth
          smile[1] === '-' || smile[1] === '~' ? 
          smile[2] === ')' || smile[2] === 'D' ? countSmiles++ : null : null;
       }
    }      
  })
  return countSmiles;
}
```
Program logic: Define counter to return later. Iterate over array looking at valid eyes. If valid eyes found, then check for length to determine if there is a nose. If no nose, check for mouth and if there is a mouth then increment the counter. Else statement is reached when there is a nose. Check for valid nose AND mouth and if this is true then increment counter. 
Ternary conditional operator can be chained to nest if statements to ensure readability and write more concise code. 

Another Answer:
```

const smileyIsValid = smiley => 
  smiley.length === 3 || smiley.length === 2

const smileyHasValidEye = smiley => {
  const maybeEye = smiley.charAt(0)
  return maybeEye === ':' || maybeEye === ';'
}

const smileyHasNose = smiley =>
  smiley.length === 3

const smileyHasValidNose = smiley => {
  const maybeNose = smiley.charAt(1)
  return smileyHasNose(smiley) ? maybeNose === '-' || maybeNose === '~' : true
}

const smileyHasValidMouth = smiley => {
  const maybeMouth = smileyHasNose(smiley) ? smiley.charAt(2) : smiley.charAt(1)
  return maybeMouth === ')' || maybeMouth === 'D'
}

//return the total number of smiling faces in the array
const countSmileys = smileys => 
  smileys.filter(smiley => 
    smileyIsValid(smiley) &&
    smileyHasValidEye(smiley) &&
    smileyHasValidNose(smiley) &&
    smileyHasValidMouth(smiley)
  ).length
```

# Detect Pangram
A pangram is a sentence that contains every single letter of the alphabet at least once. For example, the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is a pangram, because it uses the letters A-Z at least once (case is irrelevant).

Given a string, detect whether or not it is a pangram. Return True if it is, False if not. Ignore numbers and punctuation.

Answer:
```
function isPangram(string){
  return new Set(string.toLowerCase().match(/[a-z]/g)).size === 26;
}
```
A set data structure is created. A set can only have one of each character in it at a time. First the string is set to lower case and then it is filtered with regex - /[a-z]/ specifies only lowercase a to z while the 'g' after ensures the string is checked globally. Once all the alphabetical chars are added, the size of the set is compared to 26. If it's 26 then every letter of the alphabet is used and it is a Pangram and will return true.
# Convert num to string
We need a function that can transform a number (integer) into a string.

What ways of achieving this do you know?

#### Examples (input --> output):

```
123  --> "123"
999  --> "999"
-100 --> "-100"
```
Answer:
```
function numberToString(num) {
  return num.toString();
}
```
# Beginner Series #3 Sum of Numbers
Given two integers `a` and `b`, which can be positive or negative, find the sum of all the integers between and including them and return it. If the two numbers are equal return `a` or `b`.
**Note:** `a` and `b` are not ordered!
## Examples (a, b) --> output (explanation)

```
(1, 0) --> 1 (1 + 0 = 1)
(1, 2) --> 3 (1 + 2 = 3)
(0, 1) --> 1 (0 + 1 = 1)
(1, 1) --> 1 (1 since both are same)
(-1, 0) --> -1 (-1 + 0 = -1)
(-1, 2) --> 2 (-1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 2)
```
Your function should only return a number, not the explanation about how you get that number.

My answer:
```
function getSum(a, b){
  if(a===b){
    return a;
  }
  //Sort a,b and place into new array
  let arr = [a, b].sort((a, b) => a - b);
  //Using array, run a for loop to add all numbers between a,b
  for(let i = arr[0]+1; i < arr[1]; i++){
     arr.push(i);
   }
  //Return the sum of all values
  return arr.reduce((accumulator, item) => accumulator + item, 0);
}
```

Better answer:
```
const GetSum = (a, b) => {
  let min = Math.min(a, b),
      max = Math.max(a, b);
  return (max - min + 1) * (min + max) / 2;
}
```
Uses Gauss Summation: n(n+1)/2 where n is the largest number of the values you want to sum. 

Even better answer:
```
function GetSum(a,b)
{
  return (Math.abs(a - b) + 1) * (a+b) / 2;
}
```
This gets around having to figure out the min/max by using Math.abs(). 
# Beginner Series #4 Cockroach
The cockroach is one of the fastest insects. Write a function which takes its speed in km per hour and returns it in cm per second, rounded down to the integer (= floored).

For example:

```
1.08 --> 30
```

Note! The input is a Real number (actual type is language dependent) and is >= 0. The result should be an Integer.

Answer: 
```
function cockroachSpeed(s) {
  const secsInHour = 3600;
  const centimetersInKilometers = 100000;
  
  return Math.floor((s*centimetersInKilometers)/secsInHour);
}
```
# Transportation on vacation
After a hard quarter in the office you decide to get some rest on a vacation. So you will book a flight for you and your girlfriend and try to leave all the mess behind you.

You will need a rental car in order for you to get around in your vacation. The manager of the car rental makes you some good offers.

Every day you rent the car costs $40. If you rent the car for 7 or more days, you get $50 off your total. Alternatively, if you rent the car for 3 or more days, you get $20 off your total.

Write a code that gives out the total amount for different days(d).

Answer:
```
function rentalCarCost(d) {
  const dailyFee = 40;
  const threeOrMoreDiscount = 20;
  const sevenOrMoreDiscount = 50;
  return d < 7 && d >= 3 ? d*dailyFee - threeOrMoreDiscount : 
  d >= 7 ? d*dailyFee - sevenOrMoreDiscount : d*dailyFee
}
```
# Removing Elements
Take an array and remove every second element from the array. Always keep the first element and start removing with the next element.
### Example:

`["Keep", "Remove", "Keep", "Remove", "Keep", ...]` --> `["Keep", "Keep", "Keep", ...]`

None of the arrays will be empty, so you don't have to worry about that!

Answer:
```
function removeEveryOther(arr){
  return arr.filter(function(elem, index) {
    return index % 2 === 0;
  });
}
```

Filter will iterate over the array and return values that make it true. We include the index as a way to check for every other element to return.

Refactored answer:
```
function removeEveryOther(arr){
  return arr.filter((element, index) => index % 2 === 0);
}
```
